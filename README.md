# 🌠 Cosmic To-Do: Where Even Astronauts Procrastinate 🚀
Got tasks? Of course you do. But do your tasks have intergalactic flair? Didn’t think so.

Welcome to Cosmic To-Do — the only task manager that makes "forgetting to do stuff" feel like a space anomaly rather than a personal failure.

# 🪐 Why This App? (Because Earthly To-Do Lists Are Boring)
```diff
+ ✔️ Mission Control for Your Life – Track tasks like NASA tracks asteroids (but with less math).
+ ✔️ Filter Like a Cosmic Overlord – Sort by All, Active, or Completed—or yeet finished tasks into the void with Clear Completed.
+ ✔️ Motivational Space Pep Talks – "You can do it, astro!" is scientifically proven to boost productivity by 0.0001%.
| Not actually proven. But it sounds cool, right?
```

# 🛸 How It Works (Simplicity: Achieved)
- 1- Add a Task → Type your "mission" (e.g., "Find matching socks in black hole of laundry").

- 2- Check It Off → Feel the dopamine rush of a tiny checkbox. Pew!

- 3- Delete Regrets → Clear completed tasks like you’re vaporizing space junk.

# 🚨 Disclaimer
### ⚠️ Side Effects May Include:

- Mistaking your cat for an alien during late-night task entries.

- Developing a sudden urge to narrate your life like a sci-fi documentary.

- Forgetting why you opened the app because space is distracting.

## Remember: Even black holes eventually get stuff done. You got this, astro.
